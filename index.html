      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, everyone. I'm 24 years old and most certaintly the type of person who falls in love with creativity, technology, humor, and intelligence. I received my B.B.A. in Marketing degree from Washington State University and am currently pursuing my M.B.A. in Finance at Gonzaga University + this coding bootcamp. I am quite passionate and serious about my work & studies, but find tremendous joy in taking life lightly and remembering to always share ridiculous memes with my best friends.  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Olympia, Washington.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Music Production, Video Editing, Photography, Logo Design, Blogging (satirical writing), Gaming (Apex Legends), Trading/Investing, Sound Design, and spending time with friends.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Working for Twitch/Microsoft/Google as a software engineer, for Barstool Sports as a media producer / creative writer / software engineer, or for [non-specific] financial firms as a financial analyst/trader.  </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Olympia, Washington / Seattle, Washington. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Honestly, as a personal growth & intelligence challenge. And if it works out, a chance to work with some really awesome people & companies performing highly unique & skilled work. As a creative person who loves building things from scratch, I have come to realize that programming is the indefinitely deeper layer of technical creativity that I lack capaibility in. Coding bodes incredibly well with Finance and I would love to develop a software that could analyze financial analyses against market data to then autonomously suggest viable trading opportunities based on a users preferred timeline/inputs. I would also like to build web platforms for my different creative outputs (gaming, music, art, blogs, etc) for monotization. Essentially, I understand the sheer creative power associated with becoming a talented programmer and honestly I would like to see what kind of ideas my brain is capable of bringing to life when given the right tools to do so. I think the smartest people in this world can be found within the web dev community; I'm curious to see what the lifestyle is all about. </p>
