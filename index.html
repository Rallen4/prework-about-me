      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, everyone. I'm 24 years old and most certaintly the type of person who falls in love with creativity, technology, and intelligence. I have an undergraduate B.B.A. in Marketing degree with a minor in Psychology from Washington State University and am currently pursuing my M.B.A. (Finance concentration) with Gonzaga University.  I spend my free time producing music & mixes, editing & producing photos/videos, executing technical trades, performing financial analyses on potentially invesmtment-worthy companies, grinding Ranked Leagues on Apex Legends, designing abstract art in Adobe, reading/commenting on Reddit forums, building Spotify playlists, watching sports & playing in fantasy leagues, building online businesses and blogs, and of course: spending time with friends & family for drinks, dinners, and hangouts.  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Olympia, Washington.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Music Production, Video Editing, Photography, Logo Design, Blogging (satirical writing), Gaming (Apex Legends), Trading/Investing, Sound Design, and spending time with friends.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Working for Twitch/Microsoft/Google as a software engineer, for Barstool Sports as a media producer / creative writer / software engineer, or for [non-specific] financial firms as a financial analyst/trader.  </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Olympia, Washington / Seattle, Washington. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As a creative person who loves building things from scratch, I have come to realize that programming is the indefinitely deeper layer of technical creativity that bodes incredibly well with various different hobbies/interests that I currently partake in. Coding & Finance work extremely well together, as well coding + the previously discussed creative subjects. I have many ideas that I would love to bring into reality & from what I have understood, programming will help me do so.   </p>
